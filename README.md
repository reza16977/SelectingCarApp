selecting car window app by choosing Company name ,model ,color,price 

whole app by detail 

The code defines a Car class and a MainWindowViewModel class. The Car class represents a car object with properties like Company, Model, Year, Price, and CarColor. The MainWindowViewModel class serves as the view model for the main window.

The MainWindowViewModel class contains an ObservableCollection<Car> named Cars to store a collection of cars, and a List<Color> named CarColors to store a list of available car colors.

The MainWindowViewModel class also has a NewCar property of type Car to represent a new car being added. The AddCar command is used to add the NewCar to the Cars collection.

The main window's XAML code sets the MainWindowViewModel as its data context, allowing the UI elements to bind to the properties and commands of the view model.

The ListBox in the XAML binds to the Cars collection and displays the car details using a data template. The TextBlock elements show the company and model, and a Border element displays the car color. The Slider and TextBox are used to edit the price.

The TextBox elements for the company, model, and price bind to the respective properties of the NewCar object, allowing the user to enter values.

The ComboBox displays the available car colors using a data template. The selected color is bound to the CarColor property of the NewCar object.

The buttons (Add, Modify, and Delete) bind to the respective commands in the view model (AddCar, ModifyCar, and DeleteCar).

When the user clicks the Add button, the AddCarExecute method is called, creating a new Car object with the values entered in the text boxes and adding it to the Cars collection.

When the user selects a car in the ListBox, the SelectedCar property in the view model is updated.

Clicking the Modify button updates the selected car's properties with the values from the NewCar object.

Clicking the Delete button removes the selected car from the Cars collection.

In summary, the code sets up a simple WPF application with a UI for managing a collection of cars. The UI elements bind to properties and commands in the view model to enable data display, editing, and manipulation.
